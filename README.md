# NHL.com-Player-ID-List
List of Every NHL player and their NHL.com player ID number

Please note that a player being marked a goalie/skater merely means that, upon collection of the player ID numbers, there was a skater entry and a goalie entry for that player. I'm well aware that Red Horner and King Clancy aren't goalies.

Also note: When more than one player has the same name (looking at you, Sebastians Aho), I've included their birthdates for the purposes of disambiguation.
